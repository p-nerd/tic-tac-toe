## Developing

Installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.
